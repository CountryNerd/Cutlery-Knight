# Cutlery-Knight
Deranged food comes to life as you run through the map deleting them with you party. Design Patterns, Java GUI RPG 

Used this project to master complex design patterns for Object Oriented coding.

Design Patterns Implemented:
* Builder Pattern: used to creat each tile, 1 of 25 avaible tiles, and set whether the tile is solid for colision detection. 
* State Pattern: managed the switching of the states (ex: Getting touched by an enemy you will be moved from the exploration state to the battle state)
* Template Pattern: allowed us to manage the movement of the character in relation to the map and origin
* Strategy Pattern: help make applying effects/abilities to our warriors modularly
* Factory Pattern: called upon to create the enemies on the map
* Simple Factory: produced consumable items to the map
